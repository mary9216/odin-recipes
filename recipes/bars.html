        <h1>High-Fiber, High-Protein Breakfast Bars</h1>
        I came up with this recipe when my doctor told me I needed to eat more fiber, and I was sick of eating store-bought protein 
        bars for breakfast in the car between the gym and work. Ingredients such as wheat germ, flaxseed, protein powder, peanut butter,
        and oats make this a healthy way to start the day!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>cooking spray</li><br>
                <li>1 ½ cups quick-cooking oats</li><br>
                <li>¼ cup wheat germ</li><br>
                <li>¼ cup ground flax seeds</li><br>
                <li>2 tablespoons vanilla-flavored hemp protein powder</li><br>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><br>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li><br>
                <li>3 bananas</li><br>
                <li>¼ cup peanut butter</li><br>
                <li>2 tablespoons honey</li><br>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><br>
                <li>¼ cup natural peanut butter, or to taste</li><br>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <p><h4>Step 1</h4>
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with aluminum foil, letting foil hang down 
                over the sides of the pan; spray pan with cooking spray.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p><h4>Step 2</h4>
            Stir oats, wheat germ, flax seed, protein powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Mash bananas in a separate 
            large bowl and stir 1/4 cup Jif® peanut butter, honey, and vanilla extract into bananas, mixing well. Stir dry ingredients 
            into banana mixture and spread into the prepared baking dish.</p>

            <br>

            <p><h4>Step 3</h4>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Spread 1/4 cup natural peanut butter over top.</p>

            <br>

            <p><h4>Step 4</h4>
            Continue baking until lightly browned on the edges and set, 10 more minutes. Let cool in the pan and lift bars onto a 
            work surface using aluminum foil as handles. Cut into bars, wrap in plastic wrap, and store in refrigerator.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
            You can use any type of protein powder. I use hemp because it is high-fiber. If you use a very sweet powder, I'd suggest 
            lowering the amount of honey. I typically use a brand-name peanut butter inside the bars (Jif®), and then all-natural 
            to spread on top. After they are cooled, I cut them into individual servings and cover in plastic wrap for a grab-and-go 
            breakfast.
